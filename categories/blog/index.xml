      <description>Time flies when you are delivering software. It has been just over a year since the initial commit went into Github for Jenkins X, the CI/CD solution for cloud native. In just 12 months, Jenkins X progress has been breathtaking, so letâ€™s celebrate by taking a look at all that has been accomplished in this short space of time.
One of the main founders of Jenkins X is James Strachan of CloudBees, who is known for building many popular open source software projects such as Apache Groovy, Apache Camel and fabric8.</description>

      <description>The last few months have been crazy busy in the Jenkins X community. We&amp;rsquo;ve had 2 Jenkins World conferences in San Francisco and Nice, introduced serverless jenkins and tiller-less helm
Now we have released support for Cloud Native Jenkins which lets us support pluggable workloads for different teams (e.g. kubernetes workloads, traditional workloads of libraries and binaries or other workloads).
For more details on Cloud Native Jenkins please see the Cloud Native Jenkins documentation.</description>

      <description> Serverless Jenkins James Rawlings as just published an excellent article on Serverless Jenkins with Jenkins X which is well worth a read.
It describes how you can use it via the --prow feature flag when using either jx create cluster
jx create cluster gke --prow  or jx install
jx install --prow  For more details see the blog or check out the video:

      <title>Helm 2.x without Tiller</title>
      <link>https://hferentschik.github.io/jenkins-x-website/news/helm-without-tiller/</link>

      <guid>https://hferentschik.github.io/jenkins-x-website/news/helm-without-tiller/</guid>
      <description>How to avoid Tiller Helm 2.x uses a server side component called tiller. Typically Tiller is installed in a global namespace; or you can install a Tiller in each namespace and configure your helm CLI to talk to the right tiller in the right namespace.
However Tiller has a number of issues&amp;hellip;
The problem with Tiller  complicates RBAC since its not using the RBAC of the user or pod running the helm commands to read/write kubernetes resources - helm is talking to the remote tiller pod to do the work.</description>
