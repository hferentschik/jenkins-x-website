      <description>We have tried to collate common issues here with work arounds. If your issue isn&amp;rsquo;t listed here please let us know.
Jenkins X does not startup If your install fails to start there could be a few different reasons why the Jenkins X pods don&amp;rsquo;t start.
Your cluster could be out of resources. You can check the spare resources on your cluster via jx status:
jx status  A common issue for pods not starting is if your cluster does not have a default storage class setup so that Persistent Volume Claims can be bound to Persistent Volumes as described in the install instructions.</description>

      <description>How do I inject environment specific configuration? Each environment in Jenkins X is defined in a git repository; we use GitOps to manage all changes in each environment such as:
 adding/removing apps changing the version of an app (up or down) configuring any app with environment specific values   The first two items are defined in the env/requirements.yaml file in the git repository for your environment. the latter is defined in the env/values.</description>

Is Jenkins X Open Source? Yes! All of Jenkins X source code and artifacts are open source; either Apache or MIT and will always remain so!
Is Jenkins X a fork of Jenkins? No! Jenkins X currently reuses Jenkins Core and configures it to be as kubernetes native as possible.</description>

      <description>How do I add a user to my Jenkins X installation? Jenkins X assumes each user has access to the same development kubernetes cluster that Jenkins X is running on.
If your user does not have access to the kubernetes cluster we need to setup their ~/.kube/config file so that they can access it.
If you are using Google&amp;rsquo;s GKE then you can browse the GKE Console to view all the clusters and click on the Connect button next to your development cluster and then that lets you copy/paste the command to connect to the cluster.</description>

      <description>What is Helm? helm is the open source package manager for Kubernetes.
It works like other package mangers (brew, yum, npm etc) where there&amp;rsquo;s one or more repositories with packages to install (called charts in helm to keep with the nautical kubernetes theme) which can be searched/installed and upgraded.
A helm chart is basically a versioned tarball of kubernetes yaml which can be easily installed on any kubnernetes cluster.</description>
